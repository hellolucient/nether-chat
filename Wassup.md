# 🤖 Nether Chat

Yo! This is a dope project that lets people control Discord bots through a web app. Here's what's up:

## 🎯 What This Does

Imagine having your own Discord bot that you can control from a clean web interface. That's exactly what this is:
- You connect your wallet
- You get assigned a bot
- You can send messages as that bot to any channel
- It looks 100% legit on Discord's end

## 🛠 How It Works

### The Front
- Clean Discord-style interface
- Channel list on the left
- Chat box for each channel
- Connect your wallet, start chatting

### The Back
- Your wallet = Your bot (1:1 mapping)
- Each channel here = real Discord channel
- Messages go through Discord's API
- Everything's stored in Supabase

## 🎮 Features

- **No Reception**: You can only send messages, not receive them
- **Your Bot, Your Rules**: Each wallet gets its own dedicated bot
- **Channel Mirror**: All channels match the Discord server 1:1
- **Clean UI**: Looks just like Discord, feels just like home

## 🔑 Tech Stack

- Next.js for the frontend magic
- Web3 wallet stuff for connecting
- Supabase holding all the data
- Discord Bot API for the messages

## 🚀 Why This is Cool

1. Bots look 100% natural in Discord
2. No one knows they're controlled through a web app
3. Clean separation between users and bots
4. Super secure - one wallet, one bot
